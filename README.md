Project Title

Supervised Learning for Fast Pneumonia Diagnosis

**Project Overview**
The aim of this project is to investigate whether non-clinical hospital staff can use simple measurements from chest X-rays, combined with supervised learning techniques, to reliably predict pneumonia diagnoses.

**Dataset**
- Source: pneumonia_raw.csv
- Features: simple numerical measurements from X-rays
- Target: pneumonia diagnosis (Yes/No)
- Size: X rows, Y features

**Approach**

- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model selection & training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score
-Feature importance analysis

**Key Skills Demonstrated**

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Supervised learning models
- Data preprocessing and EDA
- Model evaluation & performance metrics
- Domain-impactful AI application

**Results**
- Accuracy / F1 scores of different models
- Confusion matrix plots
- Insights about which features are most predictive

**Conclusion**
Supervised learning can assist non-clinical staff in faster pneumonia diagnosis, potentially reducing patient wait times and improving hospital workflow efficiency.
